3. **Digitize Documentation**: Implement OCR and AI-powered document processing for bills, receipts, and permits
4. **Optimize Routes**: Use AI to suggest optimal routes considering traffic, fuel costs, and delivery deadlines
5. **Provide Analytics**: Generate insights on profitability, driver performance, and operational efficiency

### Secondary Objectives
1. Create a comprehensive web dashboard for business oversight
2. Implement real-time tracking and monitoring
3. Develop predictive analytics for demand forecasting
4. Enable integration with existing logistics platforms
