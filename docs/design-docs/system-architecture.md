# System Architecture - Agentic Automation for Fragmented Logistics

## Overview
This document outlines the system architecture for the AI-powered logistics automation platform designed to serve small transport businesses and independent truck owners in India.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
**Owner Web Dashboard (React.js)**
- Real-time trip tracking and management
- Financial analytics and reporting
- Driver and vehicle management
- Load discovery and assignment interface
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile access

### 2. Communication Layer
**WhatsApp Bot Interface**
- Driver interaction via WhatsApp messages
- Simple commands for availability, trip updates, and expense logging
- Document upload and processing
- Automated notifications and confirmations

### 3. Backend Services
**FastAPI Backend**
- RESTful API endpoints for all system operations
- Authentication and authorization
- Business logic implementation
- Integration with external services

**Database Layer (Supabase/Firebase)**
- User management (owners, drivers)
- Trip and load data storage
- Financial records and expense tracking
- Vehicle and fleet information
- Audit logs and system monitoring

### 4. Automation Engine (n8n)
**Workflow Orchestration**
- Automated task execution
- Integration between different components
- Event-driven process automation
- Scheduled reporting and notifications

### 5. Intelligent Agents

#### Availability Agent
- **Purpose:** Track and update driver availability status
- **Triggers:** WhatsApp messages like "FREE", "AVAILABLE", "BUSY"
- **Actions:** Update database, notify dispatch system

#### Marketplace Agent
- **Purpose:** Discover and match suitable loads
- **Data Sources:** WhatsApp groups, load boards
- **Actions:** Filter loads, notify owners of opportunities

#### Dispatch Agent
- **Purpose:** Automate trip assignment process
- **Process:** Broadcast to available drivers, handle responses, assign trips
- **Actions:** Send notifications, update trip status

#### Document Digitizer Agent
- **Purpose:** Extract data from uploaded documents
- **Technology:** OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- **Actions:** Process images, extract freight amounts, update records

#### Reporting Agent
- **Purpose:** Generate automated financial and operational reports
- **Schedule:** Weekly/monthly reports
- **Output:** Excel files, PDF reports, dashboard updates

## Data Flow Architecture

```
WhatsApp Messages → Bot Processor → Automation Engine → Business Logic → Database
                                        ↓
Owner Dashboard ← API Gateway ← Backend Services ← Event Triggers
```

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) / Firebase
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens
- **Task Queue:** Celery (for background tasks)

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React.js 18+
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI)
- **Charts:** Chart.js / Recharts
- **HTTP Client:** Axios

### AI/ML Components
- **Agent Framework:** LangChain + LangGraph
- **NLP Models:** Hugging Face Transformers
- **OCR:** Tesseract (via pytesseract)
- **Document Processing:** OpenCV + PIL

### Integration & Automation
- **Workflow Engine:** n8n
- **Message API:** WhatsApp Business API / Twilio
- **File Storage:** Cloud storage (AWS S3 / Google Cloud)

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Secure API authentication using JWT
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular security audits and updates

### Privacy Compliance
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- User consent management
- Data retention policies
- Secure data deletion procedures

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- Microservices architecture
- Load balancing for API endpoints
- Database sharding strategies
- CDN for static assets

### Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies (Redis)
- Database query optimization
- Asynchronous processing for heavy tasks
- Real-time updates via WebSockets

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local development servers
- Docker containers for consistency
- Git-based version control
- Automated testing pipelines

### Production Environment
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and logging systems

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for route optimization
- Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time tracking
- Advanced AI for dynamic pricing
- Mobile native applications
